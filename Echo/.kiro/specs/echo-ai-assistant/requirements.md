# ECHO AI Productivity Assistant - Requirements Document

## Introduction

ECHO is a personal AI productivity assistant that combines intelligent task management, habit tracking, and natural language interaction to help users optimize their productivity. The system uses a hybrid approach: local PostgreSQL database for personal data privacy, cloud-based GPT integration for AI intelligence, and a modern web interface with future desktop app support.

The core philosophy is to create a truly personal productivity companion that learns from user behavior while maintaining data privacy for sensitive productivity information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Habit Tracking

**User Story:** As someone building better routines, I want to track my daily habits with streak monitoring and pattern recognition, so that I can build consistent productive behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user defines a new habit THEN the system SHALL create a tracking schedule with customizable frequency (daily, weekly, custom)
2. WHEN a user logs habit completion THEN the system SHALL update streak counters and completion statistics
3. WHEN a habit streak is broken THEN the system SHALL record the break and restart streak counting
4. WHEN viewing habit analytics THEN the system SHALL display completion rates, streak history, and pattern insights
5. IF a user misses a habit for multiple days THEN the system SHALL provide gentle reminders and motivation

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Conversational Interface

**User Story:** As a user seeking productivity guidance, I want to chat naturally with ECHO about my tasks and productivity, so that I can get personalized insights and assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to ECHO THEN the system SHALL process the request using GPT integration
2. WHEN ECHO responds THEN the system SHALL provide contextually relevant advice based on user's task and habit data
3. WHEN a user asks for productivity insights THEN the system SHALL analyze local data and provide personalized recommendations
4. WHEN a user requests task scheduling help THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal timing based on historical patterns
5. IF the GPT API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses and queue requests for retry

### Requirement 4: PostgreSQL Data Management

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data integrity and performance, I want my productivity data stored in a robust database system, so that my information is reliable and queries are fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish connection to PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN user data is created or modified THEN the system SHALL persist changes with proper transaction handling
3. WHEN querying productivity analytics THEN the system SHALL execute optimized database queries
4. WHEN the system performs data operations THEN the system SHALL handle database errors gracefully
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Calendar Integration and Scheduling

**User Story:** As someone managing multiple commitments, I want ECHO to integrate with my calendar and suggest optimal scheduling, so that I can balance tasks with existing appointments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL sync existing events and maintain ongoing synchronization
2. WHEN ECHO suggests task scheduling THEN the system SHALL consider existing calendar commitments
3. WHEN a user creates time-blocked tasks THEN the system SHALL offer to create corresponding calendar events
4. WHEN calendar events change THEN the system SHALL update related task scheduling suggestions
5. IF calendar sync fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with local scheduling only

### Requirement 6: Analytics and Productivity Insights

**User Story:** As a user wanting to improve my productivity, I want detailed analytics about my patterns and performance, so that I can make data-driven improvements to my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses analytics THEN the system SHALL display productivity metrics, completion rates, and trend analysis
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in task completion, habit adherence, and productive time periods
3. WHEN showing progress over time THEN the system SHALL provide visual charts and graphs for easy interpretation
4. WHEN a user requests specific analytics THEN the system SHALL filter and present relevant data subsets
5. IF insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL indicate data limitations and suggest longer tracking periods

### Requirement 7: Web Interface with Modern UX

**User Story:** As a user interacting with ECHO daily, I want a clean, responsive, and intuitive web interface, so that I can efficiently manage my productivity without interface friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL load quickly and display a responsive design
2. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and maintain state
3. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and loading indicators
4. WHEN the interface displays data THEN the system SHALL use clear typography, appropriate spacing, and intuitive icons
5. IF the user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface for touch interaction and smaller screens

### Requirement 8: Desktop Application Foundation

**User Story:** As a user who wants quick access to ECHO, I want a desktop application that integrates with my operating system, so that I can access my productivity assistant without opening a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the desktop app launches THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the web interface
2. WHEN the desktop app is minimized THEN the system SHALL continue running in the system tray with quick access
3. WHEN system notifications are triggered THEN the system SHALL display native OS notifications
4. WHEN the user sets up shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support global hotkeys for quick task capture
5. IF the desktop app updates THEN the system SHALL handle updates seamlessly without data loss

### Requirement 9: API Architecture and Security

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining ECHO, I want a well-structured API with proper security measures, so that the system is maintainable, secure, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate requests and enforce rate limiting
2. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization
3. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL include appropriate headers and status codes
